            <h2 id="about">ABOUT</h2>
            <p>
              I cherish my relationships with my clients and believe in creating
              spaces that reflect their lifestyles—where they can come home to a
              space that is truly unique to them. I love getting to know my
              clients and their families and, at the end of the day, am proud to
              call them friends.
            </p>
            <p>
              As a 5th generation Sacramentan, I have deep roots in this city we
              call home. When I’m not designing, I’m usually with my fur-child,
              a Great Pyrenees named Eleanor, hanging out with friends,
              volunteering at Shriners Hospital, wine tasting and I do try to
              get an occasional trip in, here and there.

            <h2>EXPERIENCE</h2>
            <p>
              After graduating with a BA in Interior Design in 2000, I have
              concentrated on residential design. In recent years, I’ve added
              lighting design in both residential and restaurants to my bag of
              tricks.
            </p>
            <p>
              I love mixing modern with traditional—with an occasional dose of
              whimsy, of course—a combination that makes its way into most of my
              designs and, when mixed with texture and color, make the most
              approachable and beautiful spaces.

            <h2>CLIENT EXPERIENCE</h2>
            <blockquote>
              “Elizabeth’s meticulous attention to detail and impeccable style
              are what make her an amazing designer. Her warm and hilarious
              personality make her a designer I want to work with again and
              again.”
              <cite>— Brandy Shearer</cite>
            </blockquote>
            <blockquote>
              “Elizabeth has a keen, creative eye for design. She helped me
              select all the lighting and key furniture pieces for my major
              renovation project of a 1919 tudor revival. I wanted to modernize
              the lighting with new fixtures and add modern furnishings that
              worked with my historic home. Her sense of space and knowledge of
              lighting, furniture, textures, fabrics and color are spot on.
              Great attention to detail, which is a rare find in designers. A
              joy to work with and I am looking forward to our next project
              together!”
